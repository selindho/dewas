DEWAS - Auctioneer
==================

A web application written in Python (Django) that mimics the behaviour of popular auctioning sites such as Huuto.net


NOTE
----

Cron Jobs don't work out of the box, they need to be added to the cron tab (Linux) or as an automated-task-thingy-whatever (Windows). Without it the auction resolver won't work.
